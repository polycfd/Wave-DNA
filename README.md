Wave-DNA is a software tool for one-dimensional and spherically-symmetric nonlinear acoustic waves in transient and spatially variable background flow fields. The motion of the background medium is accounted for by considering a convective form of the lossless Kuznetsov wave equation, derived from first principles based on perturbations of the continuity equation and the transient Bernoulli equation, which is solved using a finite-difference method. In principle, the background flow field may be obtained from analytical solutions, numerical simulations, or experimental measurements. The acronym Wave-DNA stands for "Wave Doppler effects in Nonlinear Acoustics".

## License and Copyright
Wave-DNA is under the copyright of its developers and made available as open-source software under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Requirements

Wave-DNA has been developed and tested on Unix systems, using Linux and MacOS operating systems. The only mandatory requirement to compile and run Wave-DNA is a standard C compiler, such as [````gcc````](https://gcc.gnu.org).

Optionally, [````cmake````](https://cmake.org) (version 3.12 or higher) is required if you would like to make use of the provided compilation scripts. To use the provided Python scripts for visualizing the output of Wave-DNA, [````Python````](https://www.python.org) (version 3), [````numpy````](https://numpy.org) and [````matplotlib````](https://matplotlib.org) are required. 

## Quick start guide

Getting started with Wave-DNA using a Unix operating system, e.g. Linux or MacOS, is easy. After downloading Wave-DNA in the directory ````<path to Wave-DNA>````, define the environment variable ````WaveDNA_DIR```` to the directory in which Wave-DNA is located. Using bash, for instance, simply execute the command ````export WaveDNA_DIR=<path to Wave-DNA>```` or, even better, add this command to your bash profile. 

Now, navigate into the folder ````$WaveDNA_DIR/build```` and execute ````./cleanbuild_release.sh````. This shell script will compile Wave-DNA in _Release_ mode (meaning all optimization flags are enabled)[^1] using _cmake_ with the ````CMakeLists.txt```` file[^2] provided in this folder. That's it, you've successfully compiled Wave-DNA! 

You can now navigate to ````$WaveDNA_DIR/examples````, where you find several representative examples that demonstrate the capabilities of Wave-DNA. Each folder contains a ````README.md```` file that explains the specificities of the example(s) and how to run the example(s).

[^1]: You can compile Wave-DNA in _Debug_ mode by executing ````./cleanbuild_debug.sh````.

[^2]: Dependent on where the system libraries are located, you may need to change the ````$mylibdirs```` in the ````$WaveDNA_DIR/build/CMakeLists.txt```` file (by default, this is set to ````/usr/lib64/````).

## Repository Structure
The Wave-DNA repository is structured as follows:
- The [documentation](/documentation/) folder contains a short [pdf](/documentation/WaveDNA-Documentation.pdf) documentation of Wave-DNA. The documentation discusses the theory behind Wave-DNA and the code structure, and explains how to install and use Wave-DNA.
- The [examples](/examples/) folder contains representative examples that show how to use Wave-DNA and demonstrate the most important features of Wave-DNA. 
- The [src](/src/) folder contains all source files of Wave-DNA.
- The [.clang-format](.clang-format) file, which defines the formatting rules for the source code.
- The [.gitignore](.gitignore) file telling _git_ which folders and files to ignore.
- The [LICENSE](LICENSE) file containing the MIT License text.
- The [README.md](README.md) file is the file you are currently reading.
